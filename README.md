# Catalogue_Mailer_Sim

Each	quarter	the	manager	of	a	retail	store	divides	customers	in	two	classes	based	on	their	
purchase	behaviour in	the	previous	quarter.	Denote	classes	as	L	for	low	and	H	for	high.	The	
manager	 wishes	 to	 determine	 to	 which	 classes	 of	 customers	 he	 should	 send	 quarterly	
catalogs.	 The	 cost	 of	 sending	 a	 catalog	 is	 $15	 per	 customer	 and	 the	 expected	 purchase	
depends	on	the	customer’s	class	and	the	manager’s	action.

• If	 a	 customer	 is	 in	 class	 L	 and	 receives	 a	 catalog,	 then	 the	 expected	 purchase	 in	 the	
current	quarter	is	$20,	and	if	a	class	L	customer	does	not	receive	a	catalog	his	expected	
purchase	is	$10.

• If	a	customer	is	in	class	H	and	receives	a	catalog,	then	his	expected	purchase	is	$50,	and	
if	a	class	H	customer	does	not	receive	a	catalog	his	expected	purchase	is	$25.
The	 decision	 whether	 or	 not	 to	 send	 a	 catalog	 to	 a	 customer	 also	 affects	 the	 customer’s	
classification	in	the	subsequent	quarter.

• If	a	customer	is	class	L	at	the	start	of	the	present	quarter,	then	the	probability	he	is	in	
the	class	L	at	the	subsequent	quarter	is	0.3	if	he	receives	a	catalog	and	0.5	if	he	does	not.	

• If	a	 customer	is	 class	H	in	 the	 current	 period,	 then	 the	 probability	 that	 he	 remains	in	
class	H	in	the	subsequent	period	is	0.8	if	he	receives	a	catalog	and	0.4	if	he	does	not.
